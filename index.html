                    I started my career as a <strong>software developer</strong>, but as an early employee at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/razorpay" target="_blank"><strong>Razorpay</strong></a> (a YC alum payment processing service, often called Stripe for India), I got to see a lot of other aspects of what goes into <strong>making a product</strong> and <strong>aking it successful</strong>. I was particularly interested in closing the gap between sales confirmation and the <strong>client going live</strong> - the time when they need help and guidance with the implementation and testing. During this stint, I worked with <strong>some of the company’s largest clients</strong>, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner" target="_blank">Grofers</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank">Swiggy</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jet-airways" target="_blank">Jet Airways</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goibibo-com" target="_blank">Goibibo</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edelweiss-tokio-life-insurance" target="_blank">Edelweiss</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nykaa" target="_blank">Nykaa</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oml-entertainment" target="_blank">OML (insider.in)</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/niit" target="_blank">NIIT</a> etc.

                <p>
                    I believe <strong>client on-boarding to be the most crucial activity</strong> for the organization. This <strong>sets the tone and expectations</strong> for both parties for the lifetime of the engagement as well as <strong>reduces the time to bring money on the table</strong> by talking to clients <strong>in a language they are used to</strong>, whatever it takes. It is equally important to give them the <strong>same level of support when they are facing challenges</strong>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My interest in this <strong>unique intersection of understanding business goals, empathy and will to help out clients, and technical knowledge about software development and software</strong> in general, makes me a great fit.

                            The <strong>social impact</strong> that I can create at Raisely will be <strong>much higher</strong> than if I was working in a similar role at a technical SaaS product company. I have my views on socialism and capitalism where the work happening at a place like <strong>Raisely is much more important</strong> than making millions for investors and shareholders.

Given the team is HQed in Australia, the time overlap should also not be an issue if required since I’m <strong>just 2:30 behind ACT</strong>.

                    It wasn’t like people were not doing calculations or making graphs or cross referencing data before the existence of digital spreadsheets, but the way spreadsheets have eased up these tasks for a user is amazing.

                    It has many attributes of a good software - it’s simple to start with, can go as deep as you want, and flexible in terms of what you wanna do with it, are a few superb qualities to start with.

                    <li>
                        advanced stuff like creating a form within the spreadsheet, running complicated data analysis, creating forecasts and what-if scenarios, etc

                    I really love how they’ve put tremendous power in the hands of a user.
